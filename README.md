# Challenge Task HS 2023
## Our solution
A system to mint, buy, resell and redeem concert tickets making use of the Ethereum blockchain.

## Description of the task
This semester's challenge task (CT) is the design and implementation of ab lockchain-based solution to a specific problem that you have identified in your own life or community. Ideally, the application is a decentralized application (DApp).

Find use-case or idea for your app
Your app must include a simple frontend (e.g., HTML, Vue, React, Svelte, ...)
Your app must include a public blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Solana, ...)

## Requirements
All requirements below must be met in order to pass this lecture.
- A working prototype for your use-case.
- Use latest stable releases of chosen libraries and frameworks.
- Interaction with a public blockchain (can be testnet).
- At least 2 participants need to be involved.
- Transparent Audit Trail. Your solution must include a feature where all transactions and changes are recorded and can be viewed transparently by all participants.
- Status and process need to be shown in the frontend.

The solution may use existing libraries and code, but those must open software software.
Deliverables: 29.10.2023, 23:59 (CET) first hand-in of your initial version of your challenge task (initial version, does not need to run). Second hand-in: 03.12.2023, 23:59 (CET) - well documented infrastructure (Readme.md or can be slides) and the source code (github/gitlab or similar) via invite or email to thomas.bocek-at-ost.ch. The code and configuration should be easy to read and/or well documented. For the presentation on the 04.12.2023 and 11.12.2023, you should show the architecture, components, and design decisions in 10-15 min, a demo in 5-10 min, and the Q&A will be 5-10 min. After your presentation, you need to hand in your PDF presentation.

You are allowed to use any language, framework, and platforms. However, the supervisors are familiar with those: Golang, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, Ethereum, Bitcoin, Linux.
